# SportBnB

[SportBnB Live](https://sport-bnb.herokuapp.com/#/)

SportBnB is a full-stack web application inspired by TaskRabbit simulating a site that allow users to book professional coaches(buddies) to workout with them. All styling for the web app are done from scratch using SCSS. The UI for the website are mostly original design taking some inspiration from TaskRabbit and also [MikiyakoBayashi.com](http://www.mikiyakobayashi.com/) . The Frontend utilizes ReactJS and Redux framework, efficiently updates the browser display through the use of a virtual DOM. For backend I used Ruby on Rails along with PostgreSQL.

SportBnB is a practice coding project by Vladyslav Stadnyk.
